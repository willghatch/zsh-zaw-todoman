Install
-------

Use [zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen) or antigen.  Here is how to do it with zgen:

    zgen load zsh-users/zaw
    zgen load willghatch/zsh-zaw-todoman

Be sure to load [zaw](https://github.com/zsh-users/zaw) before this plugin, or it will scream at you.

What is this?
-------------

A *very* basic zaw source for the [todoman](https://github.com/hobarrera/todoman) 
task management program.

It only has one action for now -- marking a task as done.

Also, it doesn't play very well with todoman's colored output.  It is rough to the point
that I'm really only publishing it as an example to list in the not-in-the-main-zaw-repo source
list.
